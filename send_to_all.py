I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out from Elinstone Agency because we are developing an innovative solution called the Sleeping Beauty ChatGPT Sales Agent. This service is designed to help businesses "wake up" old leads that may have been forgotten by leveraging advanced AI powered by ChatGPT.

Here's how it works:
Imagine a lead that entered your CRM two months ago and has gone cold. Our AI can initiate a conversation with this lead via SMS or email, qualify them, and seamlessly book them into a call with your sales team (or redirect them wherever you prefer). This proactive engagement is far more effective than simply writing off old leads as dead.

Key benefits:
‚Ä¢ 100% performance-based: No setup costs, and you pay only when we generate a sale for you.
‚Ä¢ Hassle-free onboarding: Quick to start, with no upfront investment required.

If you're interested in seeing a demo or learning more about how this works, please let me know. I would be happy to walk you through the process and answer any questions.

Best regards,

Dave Mills
Founder, Elinstone Agency
